I am passionate to create software that is user-friendly and computer-friendly. My academic journey revolves around how computers have shaped our world and our minds. 

I love finding innovative and creative solutions to problems that come my way. I am a quick learner and I almost never feel the need to stop myself from learning anything new. I always venture into new dimensions and keep myself open to the latest innovations in the world of computer science, while still keeping my sanity and making the best of existing technologies. In my free time, I enjoy taking some photographs and reading books.
